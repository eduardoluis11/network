        <!-- "Follow" button.

        It's better to assign it an ID rather than a class, since I will only show this button
        in the profile page.

        But, to avoid any bugs, I will add code to prevent the user from following themselves. I will add an extra
        condition that says that if the logged user is different to the user in the profile page, to display the
        “follow” button. I could do that directly in the profile.html file by using Jinja notation. I can access the
        username from the logged user using “user.username”. And, I’m already sending via Jinja a variable called
        “username”, which stores the name of the user of the profile page. So, if both “user.username” and “username”
        are different, and if a user is logged, I will render the “Follow” button.

        BUG: For some reason, the “if” statement in profile.html is telling me that “username” is different from
        “user.username”, even though both things show the exact same text. Let me see if I can turn both into strings.
        (FIXED.)

        As for toggling the button between “follow” and “unfollow”, I will use JS code, and either a querySelector or
        a getElementByID. I will use the querySelector to check the word being printed on that button (I may convert
        that value into a string using str() to avoid bugs.) If the word being obtained is “follow”, I will change
        that button into “unfollow” if the user clicks on it (or a “submit” is being sent,) and vice-versa.

        Just like there is an event listener called “onClick()” in HTML, there’s also one called “onsubmit()” (source:
        https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ev_onsubmit.asp .) So, I will add an “onsubmit” attribute to the button in
        profile.html to call the appropriate JS function when I click on it.

        To avoid errors in React, I need to use only IDs to make the JS calls, not classes (source: Anastasiia Solop's
        reply on https://stackoverflow.com/questions/64097973/uncaught-error-minified-react-error-200 .

        If I submit an input, the entire page will reload. So, I will re-do the buttons as <button> tags, and I will
        delete the <input> tags. Also, they will be activated with an onClick(), NOT with an onsubmit. That’s so I
        don’t reload the entire page when I click on the “Follow/Unfollow” button.

        I will put the button outside of the React div. The React div will be empty, and won’t render anything until
        the user clicks on the “follow” button. Then, if the user clicks on the button, one of 2 things will happen
        with an “if” statement: 1) I will get the original button, delete it, and rebuild it, but this time, it will
        display the word “unfollow”. 2) The same as the previous condition, but I will render the word “follow”.

        I changed my mind, and decided to first render the follow button using JS. Afterwards, I will render it by using
        React. I will add the script at the bottom of the page. To call the JS script, I will add an ID to the "follow"
        button.

        After thinking things through, it’s best to initially render the “follow” button via Django, since, when I first 
        enter the page, my JS code has no way of knowing if the user is following the other person or not. So, I won’t 
        know whether to initially render “follow” or “unfollow” in the button. That could be fixed afterwards, but, for 
        the time being, I will combine Jinja and Django with JS and JSON.

        I added Jinja notation to the button to insert the name of the person from the profile. I need that to use the API.

    <!-- JS script for handling the "follow/unfollow" functionality. This will later be replaced by React code.
    
    I will first try following and unfollowing a user via a fetch() call by using vanilla JS. Afterwards, I will “translate” 
    that code into React. The disadvantage of doing this is that, at first, the follower count won’t be updated. However, I 
    can later re-do the “update follower count” by using another fetch() call to fix that, if I want to. 

    Apparently, it doesn’t matter if I use a “submit” or a “onclick”: if I use a proper fetch() call, only a small part of 
    the page will be updated.

    Remember that, if the database needs to wait a bit before being updated, I can simply add a “timeout” function to wait for 
    a few seconds before updating the part of the page that I want to update.

    I won’t necessarily have to specify “json.stringify” if I’m not getting any user input to send to the follow() view from the 
    profile page. So, just by making the fetch() call I will already send JSON data into the follow() view.
	
    Anyways, to make this call, it would be best to use a POST request. So, I will have to manually specify the POST request on 
    the fetch() call on the .html file.

    If I entered into “username/profile/follow”, I would only see a JS array saying “True” or “False”.
	
    Then, by using the fetch() call, I would make the “if” statement to render “Follow/Unfollow”, depending on whether the 
    variable says “True/False”. The “True/False” value would be stored in the “data” variable in the fetch() function. So, I 
    will render “Follow” if data is equal to “True”, or “Unfollow” if it’s equal to “False”.
	
    To call the JSON data by using JS in the .html file, I would need to use the “.” notation to call the variable that I want. 
    That is, I would need to use notation like the following:
        data.variable_that_I_want_to_access
	
    In my case, I could execute code like the following: “data.renderFollowButton”. Basically, JSON is behaving like Django’s 
    Jinja notation.

    Remember that, to create a JS function, I need to first type the word “function”. That fixed a bug that didn’t let me 
    execute the updateFollowState JS function.

    Now, to use fetch(), I will have to somehow grab the name of the person of the profile using JS, and plug that in into 
    the JS function. I could send it via a parameter from the button, and that parameter could come from Jinja notation from 
    one of the views (from the profile() view to be specific). That’s the easiest way to grab a the username of the person in 
    the profile, and send it to the JS function that changes the follow button.

    BUG: The fetch() function for the 'follow' button is almost working perfectly. The only thing is that it has a bug that 
    prevents the 'follow/unfollow' button to change to 'follow' or 'unfollow' after clicking on it. I need to reload the 
    entire page to see the button change.

    BUG FIX: Turns out that booleans in JS should be typed in lowercase (source: 
    https://bobbyhadz.com/blog/javascript-referenceerror-true-false-is-not-defined#:~:text=This%20causes%20the%20JavaScript%20engine,false%20booleans%20in%20all%20lowercase. 
    ). I was typing “True” with uppercase letters.

    I will modify the code to get the profile's username from a <span> tag in the <h1> title of the page, so that I don't
    need to plug in the username directly by using Jinja. This way, if I use React, I wont have to plug in code in Jinja 
    into React, which would cause me trouble.

    <script>

        function updateFollowState() {
            // console.log("You just clicked the 'follow' button");
