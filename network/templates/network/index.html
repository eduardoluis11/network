    <!-- I will make the index.html file the “All Posts” page. -->
    <h1>All Posts</h1>

    <!-- I will add the csrf token. For that, I will add the <form> tags in the page that will let me create posts.
    However, the form itself will be created using Django forms. For that, I will create a file called forms.py, and
    create the form there.

    I will add the form for creating a post here in the “All Posts” page.

    I will only render the form for creating a post if the user’s logged in. I should add a “login required” decorator
    in the index.html file for the <form> tag (source: my "commerce" homework submission:
    https://github.com/me50/eduardoluis11/tree/web50/projects/2020/x/commerce .)

    I will use the "as_p" notation while calling the form so that the format looks good in different screen
    sizes.

    I will print a success message if the user creates a post.-->
    {% if user.is_authenticated %}
